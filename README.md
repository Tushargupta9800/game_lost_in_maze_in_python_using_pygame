Made in python using pygame library

This is my first Tile-based game and a bit difficult than other simple platform based games

To have an idea about the game go check the screenshot folder

To play the game onto your device make sure you install python 3.8 + version

and you also install the pygame library
to install pygame library 
1) open CMD (press Start button type cmd and hit Enter)
2) write pip install pygame

if this command doesn't work then you haven't install python correctly
